In 2020 we decided to try to record all the graves and memorials in St Jamesâ€™s Churchyard, West Malvern and plot them on a survey carried out by Jim some years before.  This decision was inspired by talk of a local history project based on the Village Hall Archives, and was approved by the Churchwarden, David Matthews.  We felt that it would be of interest both to others in West Malvern and to those outside the village looking for their families' resting places, and should be available in church and online if possible.
 
For this purpose we divided the churchyard into three areas with graves, plus the two gardens of remembrance:
 
* Area A lies between the church and the Old Vicarage.
* Area B lies between the cattle grid and the main church door.
* Area C is the lower churchyard between the church and De Walden Road.
* Area D, the newer garden of remembrance, is at the western end of Area A.
* Area E, the older garden of remembrance, is to the immediate west of the church.
* Area M is a list of the memorials inside the church with their inscriptions (numbering is clockwise from north door).

The inscriptions particularly on the older graves are often difficult to read and sometimes incomplete.  We have included a few comments and translations and these are all in italics.
 
We would like to keep the Project revised and updated and hope you will let us know of any errors or omissions you find and any additional information you can provide so that we can do so!
