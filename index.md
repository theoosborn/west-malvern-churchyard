    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>2024 Pilgrim Path/Churchyard Orchard project</b></p>
    <p>As part of this project to create a space for quiet contemplation in a nature-friendly plot in the centre of West Malvern, the working party are proposing moving 11 gravestones over 100 years old, to improve the access.  They will be retained within the churchyard, and their original location recorded. (The grave markers are all within Area C) Click <a href="pilgrim_path.html">here</a> for details of the individual gravestones.  If you are a relative of any of the deceased and are concerned about this, please contact the Rev Becky Elliott on 01684 573559.</p>

In 2020 we decided to try to record all the graves and memorials in St Jamesâ€™s Churchyard, West Malvern and plot them on a survey carried out by Jim some years before.  This decision was inspired by talk of a local history project based on the Village Hall Archives, and was approved by the Churchwarden, David Matthews.  We felt that it would be of interest both to others in West Malvern and to those outside the village looking for their families' resting places, and should be available in church and online if possible.
 
For this purpose we divided the churchyard into three areas with graves, plus the two gardens of remembrance:
 
* Area A lies between the church and the Old Vicarage.
* Area B lies between the cattle grid and the main church door.
* Area C is the lower churchyard between the church and De Walden Road.
* Area D, the newer garden of remembrance, is at the western end of Area A.
* Area E, the older garden of remembrance, is to the immediate west of the church.
* Area M is a list of the memorials inside the church with their inscriptions (numbering is clockwise from north door).

The inscriptions particularly on the older graves are often difficult to read and sometimes incomplete.  We have included a few comments and translations and these are all in italics.
 
* A map of burials in areas C and E has come to light, spanning the period from 2nd August 1915 (when the ground was first taken into use) up until 1st August 1926. These include burials without markers, and therefore might be of help to those wishing to confirm the location of a person's final resting place. References are given to the index number in the parochial burial register, and to the area description on the 1926 map (see Maps page).  In many cases only a surname is given on the 1926 burial map.
 
We would like to keep the Project revised and updated and hope you will let us know of any errors or omissions you find and any additional information you can provide so that we can do so!
